          Knight Moves Cafe is the First Board Game Cafe in New England, with
          locations in Coolige Corner and Teele Square!

          Devon Trevelyan opened the doors to New Englandâ€™s first board game
          cafe in Coolidge Corner on December 22, 2013. He started Knight Moves
          Cafe with the belief that board games are a catalyst to get people to
          talk to each other. Devon wanted to create a cafe experience that was
          community-oriented, that slowed life down, and that wasn't so darn
          focused on "going, getting the coffee, doing the thing, and being
          productive."
        </p>
        <p>
          With an ever growing collection of games, delicious food and drinks,
          and an atmosphere that makes you feel at home, Devon created a place
          for friends, families, and loved ones to gather, slow life down, and
          come together face to face. Come join us, won't you?
