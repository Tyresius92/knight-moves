      <p>
        Knight Moves Cafe is the premier board game cafe in the US! We offer
        espresso, cold drinks, sandwiches, and a huge collection of board games.
        Board Game Cafes are still new to the US, and they don’t all function
        exactly the same way. Here is a quick breakdown of how Knight Moves Cafe
        works.
      </p>
      <h3>Playing Games?</h3>
      <p>
        Pay the Game Fee and play as long as you want! The Game Fee covers you
        until we close, so you are free to leave and reenter as many times as
        you want!
      </p>
      <h3>Not Playing Games?</h3>
      <p>
        Purchase any item from our menu and you are welcome to use our WiFi and
        space as long as you like.
      </p>
      <h3>Bringing in Outside Food or Drinks?</h3>
      <p>
        Pay the Outside food and drink fee. The outside food and drink fee is
        per person, not per item, so feel free to bring in as much of whatever
        you like. Don’t like whats on our menu? Why not order a pizza? We also
        have a collection of glassware, so no need to bring cups!
      </p>
      <h3>Picking out Games?</h3>
      <p>
        We have hundreds of games in our collection! If you are having a hard
        time finding a specific game, or just want a suggestion, ask our expert
        staff for help! If we can’t find exactly what you're looking for, we can
        help point you in the right direction.
      </p>
      <h3>Play, Have Fun, Repeat</h3>
      <p>
        Play as many games as you want, for as long as you want, until we close!
      </p>
